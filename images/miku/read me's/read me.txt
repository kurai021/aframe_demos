Hi, this is 'Ria !
Thank you for downloading this edit, and reading this readme.

Let's read the rules (yaaaaaaay so funnyyyyy) !

	- credit me ! (and Tda, Kaneko Ran and iXima if you want)
	- do not claim it as your own.
	- you can edit the model as long as it stays the same character.
	- you can redistribute the edited model as long as you credit me.
	- you can't redistribute the original model (you have to link back to the da url please)
	- no R-15, R-18 or anything like that.
	- have fun ! :D

Credit goes to
